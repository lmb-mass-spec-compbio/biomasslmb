The goal of `biomasslmb` is to provide functions to pipe together proteomics data analysis pipelines for data generated by the Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

It builds upon the Bioconductor package for quantitative proteomics, [`QFeatures`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QFeatures.html). It also provides some more esoteric and/or opinionated functionality for proteomics data analysis. Much of the initial code is a re-working of [`camprotR`](https://github.com/CambridgeCentreForProteomics/camprotR), which was designed to work with [`MSnbase`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html): 

## Installation

You can install the development version of biomasslmb like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("lmb-mass-spec-compbio/biomasslmb", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform some simple filtering for PSM-level quantification from TMT proteomics.

``` r
library(QFeatures)
library(biomasslmb)
tmt_qf <- readQFeatures(assayData = psm_tmt_total,
                        quantCols = 36:45, 
                        name = "psms_raw")

tmt_qf[['psms_raw']] <- update_average_sn(tmt_qf[['psms_raw']])

tmt_qf[['psms_filtered']] <- filter_TMT_PSMs(tmt_qf[['psms_raw']], inter_thresh=50, sn_thresh=5)
```
