# Get the amino acid sequence around a PTM

Get the amino acid sequence around a PTM. Will return NA if peptide maps
to multiple proteins or has multiple PTMs. If padding extends outside
the protein AA sequence, padding will be extended with '\_'.

## Usage

``` r
get_sequence(proteome, protein, ptm_position, pad = 7)
```

## Arguments

- proteome:

  `XStringSet` as generated by
  [`Biostrings::readAAStringSet`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Biostrings/man/XStringSet-io.html)

- protein:

  `character` protein ID

- ptm_position:

  `numeric` position of the PTM in the protein

- pad:

  `numeric` Number of amino acids around PTM

## Value

`character` PSM-centered amino acid sequence
