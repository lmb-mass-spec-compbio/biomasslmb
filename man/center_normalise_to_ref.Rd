\description{
Center-median normalisation is a simple normalisation method
that is appropriate for relative abundance proteomics such as isobaric tagging.
This can be achieved with \code{QFeatures::normalize(method='diff.median')}. However,
for some experimental designs, the normalisation should be against the medians
in another dataset. For example, for PTM studies, one may wish to isobaric
tag samples, pool, and then PTM-enriched, with the enriched sample quantified
in a separate run to the non-enriched (total) sample. In this case, it may make
more sense to center-median normalise the PTM-enriched samples using the median
from the total samaples.
