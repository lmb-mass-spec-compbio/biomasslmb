\title{Extract the number of samples each feature was detected in for each experiment in a Qfeatures object}
\usage{
get_samples_present(obj, rowVars, rename_cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\code{QFeatures} object}

\item{rowVars}{\verb{character vector} row variables to group by, e.g 'Master.Protein.Accessions'}

\item{rename_cols}{\verb{named character vector} optional named list to rename the experiments. List values should be current experiment names and list names should be updated experiment names}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} object.
}
\description{
When exploring the proteome coverage, it is instructive to consider how many samples a protein
was present in for each level of filtering. This function takes a Qfeatures object and tallies how many samples a variable in the \code{rowData}
was present in. When the row variables are the protein names, the tally is thus the number of samples the protein was present in.
