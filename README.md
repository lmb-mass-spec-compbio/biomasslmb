`biomasslmb` is an R package which provide functions to pipe together proteomics 
data analysis pipelines using 
[`QFeatures`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QFeatures.html) 
for data generated by the 
[Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/scientific-facilities-and-support-services/mass-spectrometry-home/) 
at the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/).

Alongside the general purpose functions for routine proteomics data analyses, 
this package also provides some more esoteric and/or opinionated functionality 
for bespoke proteomics data analysis. 

Much of the initial code is a re-working of 
[`camprotR`](https://github.com/CambridgeCentreForProteomics/camprotR) 
which was co-developed by Charlotte Dawson (https://github.com/csdaw) and myself 
(https://github.com/tomsmithCGAT) and was designed to work with 
[`MSnbase`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html). 
Hence I've reworked the code here as a separate package to work with `QFeatures` 
to simplify issues with backward compatibility. Thank you to Charlotte for any of 
the code lifted from `camprotR` for which I had no part in writing!

## Installation
