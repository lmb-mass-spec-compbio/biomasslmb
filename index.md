# biomasslmb

`biomasslmb` is an R package which provide functions to pipe together
proteomics data analysis pipelines using
[`QFeatures`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QFeatures.html)
for data generated by the [Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics
Facility](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/scientific-facilities-and-support-services/mass-spectrometry-home/)
at the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular
Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/).

Alongside the general purpose functions for routine proteomics data
analyses, this package also provides some more esoteric and/or
opinionated functionality for bespoke proteomics data analysis.

Much of the initial code is a re-working of
[`camprotR`](https://github.com/CambridgeCentreForProteomics/camprotR)
which was co-developed by Charlotte Dawson (<https://github.com/csdaw>)
and myself (<https://github.com/tomsmithCGAT>) and was designed to work
with
[`MSnbase`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html).
Hence I’ve reworked the code here as a separate package to work with
`QFeatures` to simplify issues with backward compatibility. Thank you to
Charlotte for any of the code lifted from `camprotR` for which I had no
part in writing!

## Installation

You can install the development version of biomasslmb like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("lmb-mass-spec-compbio/biomasslmb", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Examples
